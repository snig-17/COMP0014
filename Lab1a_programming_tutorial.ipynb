Constructors run when a new object of this class's type is first created (*instantiated*). The first argument in the `__init__` function is `self`, which is a special variable representing the created object itself. So when I say `self.dividend = dividend`, it is essentially copying the value of `dividend`, which is sent into the constructor, into the data that this object always keeps around with it (its *member data* or *member variables*).\n",
